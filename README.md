An entry for js13kGames 2018

## Description

Bring your customers back online!

You are running your own litte ISP in the city, for some reason some of
your customers gets offline. As you're the only one in the company you
need to investigate and fix their problems. Oh, and you don't have a car
or bike or even a skateboard either.


## Controls

The game supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad and device orientation
("gaze") controls.

VR controls:
  * move left/right: tilt your head left/right
  * jump: look up
  * slide: look down
  * click: look at object

By default mouse is enabled on desktop, and gaze control for VR. Press a
button/key on your keyboard/controller/gamepad during the startup to
configure.

The game is heavliy work in progress, it still needs a lot of features.
But hey, it's playable! Kind of.
